*Societal pressures are developed under the influence of normality, difference, and given roles. Women, despite identifying as women, can relate to one another because of societal pressures and disturbances aimed at them. Yet, the external pressures are not powerful enough to be completely detrimental to women and their ability to persevere. This is a culture, identifying with other women through their experiences and hardships, and their ability to overcome. Using portraiture, coding, and recordings I sought to represent this culture of women enduring external forces seeking to break them down. Instead of allowing society, a viewer, to disintegrate them, their strength brings them back together to continue.*
